This repository contains three multithreaded programs implemented in different programming languages: C++, Java, and Pthread. Each program solves a different problem and uses multithreading to improve performance.

## 4.17 Monte Carlo Pi (./monte-carlo)
The monte-carlo program estimates the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method. 

## [optional] (4.21**) Fibonacci Sequence (./fib)
The fib program generates the Fibonacci sequence using multithreading. 

## 6.33* Monte Carlo Pi with Mutex (./monte-carlo-mutex)
The monte-carlo-mutex program is an extension of the monte-carlo program. The program protects against race conditions on updates to the shared global variable by using mutex locks.
